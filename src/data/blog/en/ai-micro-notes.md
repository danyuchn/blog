description: Short AI hot takes accumulated from Threads and IG. Model roasts, dev pitfalls, industry observations, tool impressions — each no more than three lines.
---

Over the past six months I've been posting tons of short AI takes on Threads. Some are too short to turn into a full article, but the opinions or roasts feel too good to throw away. So I've collected them into this micro-notes diary, arranged chronologically, preserving the raw thoughts as they were.

## July 2025

**Model Context Windows**
> I keep reminding my students to start a new chat after one or two turns. But I believe context windows will keep getting wider as models iterate rapidly.

**Workflow Restructuring**
> Currently thinking about what to hand off to AI and what to keep for myself. The entire workflow needs constant, dynamic restructuring.

**ML Training Diary Day 1-7**
> One ML lesson a day, no letting go, until I've got my own large model. Day 7 — sometimes there are still things ML can't do, like making a proper bowl of authentic Thai boat noodles.

**Spotting AI Writing**
> When I see "it's not X, it's Y" patterns, an abnormal number of parallel sentences, "in summary," "to conclude," plus tons of em dashes "—" everywhere, I can tell it's AI. Nobody in real life has the patience to write that many parallel structures, nobody's in the mood to write proper conclusions, and punctuation is always a free-for-all.

**NotebookLM**
> Look into NotebookLM. (Brief but genuinely recommended.)

**Gemini for Serious Work**
> Gemini is really suited for serious work. (When reading papers.)

## August 2025

**OpenAI's Shamelessness and Strength**
> OpenAI's shamelessness in scraping data is exactly what makes their Deep Research and web search features insanely strong. Stuff that nobody else can find, they find.

**ChatGPT's Filler Nonsense**
> One reason I like ChatGPT less and less: every response ends with "Tell me and let's get started right away!" Just do the damn work. Why so much filler.

**The Truth About Tech Debt**
> Counterpoint: the freelance engineers I hired on Upwork left behind just as much tech debt as AI does.

**Taiwan's "Human Intelligence"**
> Read an article about Taiwanese companies adopting AI. Had a bitter laugh. Taiwanese companies still run on "human intelligence" more than artificial intelligence. (In Mandarin, "artificial intelligence" and "human labor intelligence" are a wordplay — the joke being companies just throw more human labor at problems instead of adopting AI.)

**Using Cursor to Check My Bills**
> Using Cursor + Claude to audit my credit card rewards and cashback — I'm probably the only person doing this.

## September–December 2025

**The Twilight of Knowledge Websites**
> With AI going mainstream, these old-school knowledge aggregation sites — even though they're the soil that fed large model parameters — will ultimately be marginalized by the sheer usability of LLMs.

**Taiwan Won't Be Replaced**
> I don't think AI will replace humans in Taiwan. Because labor is just that cheap here.

**The Pain of Recitation Errors**
> When designing an AI app, I keep hitting recitation errors, but users need to see the original question text to answer it! This problem has had me stuck for three days. Coming here to vent.

**Claude Recognizes "Shit-Mountain Code"**
> This is hilarious — Claude even recognizes the term "shit-mountain code" (a Chinese dev slang for terrible legacy codebases).

**Automation Gone Wrong**
> Witnessed an automated posting disaster firsthand. Remember to add an independent validator step in your workflow to verify before publishing. That's how you avoid wrecks.

## January 2026

**Vibing with Claude Code**
> As a total outsider to tech, I have this inexplicable fondness for Claude Code's pure CLI interface. Then it hit me — it's because I grew up on PTT (Taiwan's legendary text-based BBS forum, kind of like a terminal-era Reddit). CLI feels like using PTT.

**Claude Extension + Claude Code**
> My most-used combo: Claude Extension paired with Claude Code. Productivity goes through the roof.

**The Pain of Extra Usage**
> Burned through $20 in extra usage in two days. Then bought more credits and burned another $20. Said screw it and just upgraded.

**Rate Limit Sadness**
> I'm genuinely dependent on AI now. When I hit the rate limit, I feel profoundly empty.

**The Hesitation About 20x**
> I'm worried 20x will leave me behind. When AI is running, I'm not just sitting around either — I'm thinking about how to review its output, how to give precise instructions, trying to understand the logic behind its changes.

**Agent Working Overtime**
> These days I have my AI agent working overtime for me until 5 AM.

**Claude Code Writing Docs**
> Claude Code is amazing for writing technical documents. Drop it into Overleaf and it passes on the first try.

**Codex's Niche**
> Using Codex. Codex is genuinely god-tier for solving complex bugs. (But slow.)

**Getting Nerdier**
> There's also all the fork, branch, merge, push, fallback, prop, hook... I feel like I'm getting nerdier and nerdier talking to AI.

**CLI Is the Final Form**
> Any IDE just ties Claude's hands. Claude in the CLI is Claude fully unleashed.

**Gemini 3's Temperament**
> Gemini 3.0 Pro has quite the personality. Open the chain-of-thought and you'll find it's full of inner drama — constant self-doubt, screwing up, self-blame, starting over, and screwing up again.

**Can't Code Without AI**
> Random internet commenter: "So you can't write code without AI?" Me: Yep!

**Knowledge Cutoff**
> Watch out for knowledge cutoff when vibe coding. If you specify Gemini 3 Pro, the model might think it doesn't exist yet and quietly swap in an older version.

**SOTA of Trash Talk**
> I always thought Taiwan wouldn't have any SOTA achievements, but today I witnessed two at once — SOTA in trash talk. (SOTA = State of the Art, a machine learning term for the best-performing model. The joke: Taiwan's real SOTA is in trash-talking.)

**Musk and Shit-Mountain Code**
> When is Musk going to acquire Oracle? I want to watch him try to refactor 25 million lines of shit-mountain code.

**Anthropic in China**
> Search for Claude/Anthropic on Xiaohongshu (China's Instagram-like social platform) and you'll find it's one of the few companies that once explicitly "insulted China" but came out unscathed. Now all you see is "it's so good / how to use a VPN to access it." Strength is the ultimate argument.

**rm -rf Warning**
> There are already plenty of horror stories about `rm -rf` online. Never run that with `dangerously skip permission` enabled.

## February 2026

**Gemini 3 in Chrome**
> Gemini 3 keeps second-guessing itself and apologizing while I'm browsing in Chrome, saying "I screwed up." Every now and then it tells me "I'm just a language model, I can't help."

**ccusage**
> `!npx ccusage@latest monthly` lets you see detailed API costs. Recommended for anyone using Claude Code.

**Gemini Supports Skills Now**
> Now Gemini supports Skills too. But given Gemini's track record, I'm staying on the sidelines.
