description: Welcome to Dustin's AI Lab — a blog about practical AI workflows, tools, and insights for learning and productivity.

Welcome to my blog.

I've been working with AI tools daily — building crawlers, writing with LLMs, automating workflows, and coaching students on how to learn smarter with AI. Along the way, I kept running into the same problem: the gap between what AI *can* do and what people *actually* do with it.

This blog is my attempt to bridge that gap. I'll share what I build, what works, what breaks, and what I learn from it all.

## What to Expect

- **AI Workflows** — real automation pipelines, not toy demos
- **Tool Reviews** — honest takes on Claude Code, Cursor, and other AI dev tools
- **Content Systems** — how I use AI for writing, translation, and analysis
- **Learning x AI** — how AI is changing the way we study and teach

## Why Now

The AI tooling landscape moves fast. Writing helps me think clearly about what matters and what's noise. If even one post saves you an afternoon of trial and error, it's worth it.

Let's go.
