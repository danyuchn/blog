Hi, I'm Dustin Yuchen Teng — an AI practitioner and educator based in Bangkok.

I run [PDT Learning](https://pdtlearning.com), where I help people integrate AI tools into their learning and productivity workflows. I also coach GMAT prep at [dustingmat.com](https://dustingmat.com).

## What This Blog Is About

This blog documents my hands-on experience with AI tools, workflows, and systems. Topics include:

- **AI Workflows** — Building practical automation with LLMs, APIs, and agents
- **Developer Tools** — Claude Code, Cursor, and other AI-powered dev tools
- **Content Systems** — Using AI for content creation, translation, and analysis
- **Learning with AI** — How AI changes the way we study and teach

I write in both English and Chinese, depending on the topic and audience.

## Why I Write

I believe the best way to learn is to build things and share what you discover along the way. This blog is my lab notebook — part tutorial, part reflection, part experiment log.
